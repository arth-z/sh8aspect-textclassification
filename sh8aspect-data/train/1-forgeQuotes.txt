Change follows fire.
Break a thing, and you have fragments. Break those fragments, and you have dust. Break the dust, and then break what remains. Here is fire.
IN THE DESERT I WAIT IN THE RUINS I BURN - METAL IS WATER - STONE IS WAX - FLESH IS SMOKE - ENTER ME AND BE NO LONGER.
What has been broken can be reforged. What has never been broken must be reforged.
If the Forge could regret, it would regret the Intercalate, but in all its other work, it knows joy.
Fire is the winter that warms and the spring that consumes.
In certain operations of the Forge, sunlight is said to overcome moonlight, as we pass from the Meniscate to the Madrugad.
The Forge of Days, the Meniscate and the Madrugad are gods-from-Light. Mercury, silver and gold are the seeds of the Work, and here is their secret doctrine.
Tools will only get in the way.
I will shape what is broken into what is necessary.
I am the hammer and the anvil; I am the fire's touch and the iron's blessing. I pledge myself to the final conflagration.
This is alchemy's savage summit: the deadly blue of fire outpacing light. Touch it and die.
The Forge remakes with fire; the Forge destroys what cannot be changed; the Forge ends all nights.
Scarlet is the colour of heat. Mercury holds one key to an ultimate dissolution.
The air shimmers like a naked furnace. Something will be changed - something will be destroyed.
Fire and ingenuity - when has it failed us?
Who is the fire, and who is the fuel?
The artisan may achieve their highest goal only by destroying their most precious tool. 
The Dawnbreaker core - a radiant cage of curved metal, imprisoning a blazing mote of solar fire.
In five continents, smiths have whispered the same words to the iron. Murderers have been known to whisper these words, too. And adepts, of course. These words are spoken in ritual to inspire an unmerciful Change.
