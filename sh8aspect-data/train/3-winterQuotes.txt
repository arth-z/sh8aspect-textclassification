Silence waits west of the world, but not forever.
Step closer to the sunset, and see the first stars of night.
The world is still as ice. Each movement is a journey.
Everything ends.
An oil painting of a silent city, foundered in snow. Behind its bleakest tower, a sickle moon rises.
Winter can be delayed, but never denied.
Wait in the white on the walls. Watch the sun slow. Chione walks the streets in silence. Her skirts are the wind. So white her surface. See what ceases in the storm.
The air is frosty, the candles gutter, the street-sounds are hushed. Someone is here.
Sleep, now. Don't worry about a thing.
What may be lost? My childhood. My burdens. My illusions. My pride. My reputation. My shadow. My heart.
The world forgets, but the Ivory Dove does not.
I will remember what all others have forgotten.
Beneath the soil, bones. In the bones, memory. In the memory, colours.
Winter passes the clothes, passes the skin, nestles in the veins.
When the Forge is cold and the Glory is dark and the Wood is dust, perhaps the Wolf Divided will rest, but only until it can devour itself.
She says nothing. Silence pools like shadow between the gallery lamps.
These are the words which chill the air and drink the colour of my skin.
In the darkness of the mind, between our shadows, we hide the things we wish we could forget.
In the snow, in the silence, in the white without colours - all we can do is rest.
Despair is the wolf that devours thought.
