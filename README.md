# sh8aspect-textclassification
 An amateur machine learning project to classify short text passages based on the eight occult Principles of Weatherfactory's Secret Histories setting. Created with TensorFlow.
 
 Training data is small, and was created from both my writing/impressions of the aspects, and Cultist Simulator's in-game text from https://uadaf.theevilroot.xyz/frangiclave/
